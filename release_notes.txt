Login, registration, setting password and all the following templates were created. Also templates' code was updated.
The main page was updated and now it is adaptive.
I have created registration folder, besause it is necessary if we use django.contrib.urls (you can see that in pizzeria.urls). I also created
another folder for registration, and we can use it for users' profiles. I also use base user model, because I could't use
our custom model in practice
